# Advertising-Data-Logistic-Regression
Applying logistic regression to find out statistics on an advertising dataset for a company.

I will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
Data Source and guidence credits: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Udemy Course.

I will be visualizing the data first and then applying logistic regression to train the model and reach a conclusion.
